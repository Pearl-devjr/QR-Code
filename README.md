### What I learned

There were no major learnings. I just learnt how to make a website responsive through the use of the following code snippets:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
```css
body{
    min-width: 375px;
    max-width: 1440px;
}
.container{
    width: 280px;
    margin: auto;
    margin-top: 25%;
    margin-bottom: 25%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about making a website responsive and importing a customized font.
